# Nolli-Cannolli

N-C is a project that fine-tunes a diffusion model on Nolli maps to easily generate baseline geometry with diverse urban form. 

The model creates images that hybridize the urban fabric from any city and can be adapted to a specific site boundary. These images feed into a Grasshopper script to generate 3d massing with customizable density.

## Milestones:

- [x] 3,400 Nolli Map Dataset Generated (ArcGIS)

- [x] Early LLM Nolli Description/Labeling (Manual/Claude)

- [x] Lora, CNN+LLM, Dreambooth fine-tuning explored

- [x] Fine-tuned 2 Stable Diffusion v2 Models

- [x] Bitmaps to 3D Forms in Grasshopper C#

- [x] Shape Diver UI

- [x] Presentation Deck
