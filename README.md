Nolli-Cannolli

N-C is a project that fine-tunes a diffusion model on Nolli maps to easily generate baseline geometry with diverse urban form. 

The model creates images that hybridize the urban fabric from any city and can be adapted to a specific site boundary. These images feed into a Grasshopper script to generate 3d massing with customizable density.

Project Workstreams:
